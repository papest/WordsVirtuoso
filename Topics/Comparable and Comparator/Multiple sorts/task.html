  <p>Let's say you have a list of users and each user is represented by an object of the User class, which has the fields name, age and email.</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-kotlin">data class User(val name: String, val age: Int, val email: String)</code></pre> 
  <p>Write the <strong>UserComparator</strong> class that implements the <strong>Comparator</strong> interface to sort the list of users by their age in ascending order, and if the age of some users is the same, then sort them alphabetically by the username.</p>
