  <p>Ryan Gosling was upset when he read the discussions about Drive's finale. He is absolutely sure that his character didn't die after all that happened in the movie. And he decided to write a small program that adds the phrase <code class="java">"Note! I didn't die at the end of Drive"</code> in a new line after each of his own messages on the Instagram. Please help Rayan using a scope function.</p>
