  <p>Hey, cool news! Ryan Gosling became your regular customer, and he appreciates working with such a developer like you. Ryan came to you with a new task: he plays in a cool band Dead Man’s Bones, and he wants to be able to change the settings of his microphone from song to song. He wrote a template with a data class <code class="java">Microphone</code>. New settings will come from standard input, and your job is to write a scope function that will implement them.</p>
