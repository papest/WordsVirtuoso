  <p>The tabletop role-playing games usually use multiple dices with various number of faces. Most often the RPG dices have 4, 6, 8, 12 and 20 sides.</p> 
  <p>Let’s consider a RPG game where all decisions are made by throwing 2 dices with different number of faces. Create the <code class="java">rpgDices</code> function that gets as arguments the number of the faces of 2 dices and returns the sum of the result of rolling both of them.</p>
